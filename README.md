# A front-end developer toolkit

#### Because I think that the best css/js toolkit is composed by many **agnostic** micro libraries.


- ### Sass MQ
  A Sass mixin that helps you compose media queries in an elegant way.  
  > My favourite to make perfectly customized media queries

- ### LazySizes
  High performance and SEO friendly lazy loader for images (responsive and normal), iframes and more, that detects any visibility changes triggered through user interaction, CSS or JavaScript without configuration.
